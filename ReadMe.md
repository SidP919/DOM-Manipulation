# DOM Manipulation

**What is DOM ? :** DOM( Document Object Model) represents structure and elements in the webpage which can then be manipulated by our javascript program/script and can change the document structure, style and its content.

## Description:

> This repo is for those who have learned the basics of JavaScript and are now ready to use the power of JavaScript further to build some apps using DOM Manipulation.

**This repo is divided into three parts:**

- [**Part-01-Practice-DOM-Manipulation**](https://github.com/SidP919/FS-JS-WD-B-DOM-Manipulation#part-01-practice-dom-manipulation)

- [**Part-02-Complete-DOM-Assignments**](https://github.com/SidP919/FS-JS-WD-B-DOM-Manipulation#part-02-complete-dom-assignments)

- [**Part-03-Build-Apps-using-DOM-Manipulation**](https://github.com/SidP919/FS-JS-WD-B-DOM-Manipulation#part-03-build-apps-using-dom-manipulation)

#

## Part-01-Practice-DOM-Manipulation

![Part-01](./Part-01-Practice-DOM-Manipulation/thumbnail.png)

- In this part, we will go through a ReadMe file containing 20 small examples with solutions showing how to do DOM Manipulation on some popular websites by putting some code in the console window inside developer tools in the browser. 

- Before you proceed to other parts, please check the mentioned ReadMe file [here](https://github.com/SidP919/FS-JS-WD-B-DOM-Manipulation/tree/Main/Part-01-Practice-DOM-Manipulation#javascript.md)

#

## Part-02-Complete-DOM-Assignments

![Part-02](./Part-02-Complete-DOM-Assignments/thumbnail.png)

- In this part, we will get code of 16 partially-build apps, and we will need to make changes in the javascript files( FileName ending with `.js`) inside each app's folder, to make each app work properly and same as it is shown in the image inside the **Image** folder inside each app's folder.

- You can see these apps in action at this live link - [https://dom-assignments.netlify.app](https://dom-assignments.netlify.app)
- You can find folders of all apps and their code in [here](https://github.com/SidP919/FS-JS-WD-B-DOM-Manipulation/tree/Main/Part-02-Complete-DOM-Assignments)

#

## Part-03-Build-Apps-Using-DOM-Manipulation
![Part-03](./Part-03-Build-Apps-Using-DOM-Manipulation/thumbnail.png)
- In this part, we won't get any resources or partially-completed code for the apps. We will only have a problem statement for each app to be build and we will need to build them from scratch.

- You can see the apps built so far in action at this live link - [https://dom-apps.netlify.app](https://dom-apps.netlify.app)

- For a complete list, code and links of apps that we have build so far and the problem statements of all the apps to be build, please check [here](https://github.com/SidP919/FS-JS-WD-B-DOM-Manipulation/tree/Main/Part-03-Build-Apps-Using-DOM-Manipulation)

## Time taken to complete all three parts:
- Part-01 - 12 hrs

- Part-02 - 21 hrs

- Part-03 - 8 hrs(To Be Continued)
